car is missing, etc.

## What do I need to run? üîÑ

To deploy this project in your local environment, this are the steps in order to
execute it:

- `$ git clone https://github.com/guillermoar26/Practica4-Sistemas-Internet-23-24-Guillermo.git`
- Open the project in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

_You may need to install deno in your computer, check references
[here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)_

- add your own **.env** values!!! In this commit there is a **env.sample**, feel
  free to use it with your own sensitive data! (Otherwise it won't work...)

- In your cli, add this command `$ deno task dev` (Oops! Make sure you do it in
  the right directory)

Congratulations! If you came so far, you will see this message on console:
`Server ready on http://localhost:8080/`

# 

or... of course you can use **Deno Deploy** to avoid deploying the project
locally and go straight-forward to Postman! _Remember, browsers only processes
GET methods, so if you want to use the remaining methods, use Postman or
whatever you get comfortable with!_
